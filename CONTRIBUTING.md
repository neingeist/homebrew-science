First of all, thank you for contributing to [Homebrew/science](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science). The following guidelines are designed to help you write more efficient pull requests and/or issues.

## Issues

#### First, please read the [Troubleshooting Checklist](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/wiki/troubleshooting).

See also Homebrew's [FAQ](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/wiki/FAQ) and [Common Issues](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/wiki/Common-Issues).

#### New Issues

* Search [open](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science/issues?state=open) and [closed](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science/issues?page=1&state=closed) issues before submitting a new issue. Duplicates will be closed.
* Strictly one formula per issue unless your issue is about different formulae interacting negatively.
* Give the full `brew` command that you used and that caused the error to emerge.
* **If a formula fails to brew, always [gist](https://gist.github.com) the full logs and post links in the issue. One may be automatically generated with `brew gist-logs --config --doctor <formula>`.**

## Formula Guidelines

Please first read Homebrew's [Formula Cookbook](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/wiki/Formula-Cookbook) and [Acceptable Formulae](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/wiki/Acceptable-Formulae). This section lists additional guidelines that should be followed in Homebrew/science.

#### Tests

We insist that formulae in Homebrew/science always be accompanied by tests. Not all formulae currently in Homebrew/science have meaningful tests but the idea is to improve them over time.

Tests can be in the form of a `make test` or `make check`, a `test` method, or (if possible) both. If your package doesn't provide tests, that should be specified in the pull request. Meaningful tests are preferred over simple commands like `system "foo", "-v"`.

Whenever install-time tests in the form of `make test` or `make check` take more than a few seconds, an option offering to disable tests should be included. Running the tests by default is preferable. Use the option `without-check` to disable your build-time tests. See [Testing / Checking](#testing--checking).

#### Logical Guidelines

* **Patches should be submitted upstream. Describe and link to the issue in your comments.**
* Group mandatory, optional, and recommended dependencies together.
* Group other options together.

#### Stylistic Guidelines

* Follow the [GitHub Ruby Styleguide](https://github.com/styleguide/ruby).
* Use inline `if` and `unless` whevener possible and reasonable (e.g., `depends_on "foo" if build.with? "bar"`, `system "make", "check" if build.with? "check"`).

## Submitting a Pull Request

#### Checklist

* One formula per pull request.
* When modifying an existing formula, avoid cluttering the patch with unnecessary changes.
* Please check [open pull requests](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science/pulls) before submitting a new pull request. Duplicate pull requests will be closed.
* Fix anything reported by `brew audit foo` when you submit `foo.rb`.
* Head-only formulae belong in Homebrew/headonly or their own tap.

#### New Pull Requests

* Please give your pull request an informative title. Each pull request title and commit message should start with the name of the formula, followed by a colon and short comment. For example:
    - `foo 1.2.3 (new formula)`
    - `bar 0.1.2`
    - `baz: add test`
    - `qux: make X11 optional`

* Please keep the commit message to a minimum. GitHub lets you describe your pull request at length when you submit it.
* Be sure to include a `make test` / `make check` if available. If the test or check takes more that a few seconds, a `--without-check` option should be available to disable it. The test or check must be enabled by default.

#### Pull Request vs. Tap

In some cases, it may make more sense for you to host a Homebrew tap than to include your formula(e) in Homebrew/science. Here are a few guidelines to keep in mind when making your decision.

Homebrew/science may give your formula wider visibility but a tap may be preferable when:

* Your formula is part of a group of specialized and/or related formulae.
* The source code or releases are very frequent so that the formula(e) must be updated frequently.
* Your formula should be brewable urgently.

It can be a good idea to start with your own tap and submit to Homebrew/science later.

#### Will My Pull Request Be Merged?

Probably, but please pay attention to the points above. The more careful you are with your code, the smoother the process will be.

If it takes a while for us to get back to you, relax. We work on Homebrew/science on our own time. We're glad you're contributing and we'll do our best to keep you waiting as little as possible. It's fine to ping us to remind us of your request after a few days.

If you'd like your formula(e) to be brewable urgently, the best option may be for you to host your own tap, even if it's temporary.

## Useful Snippets and Notes

#### Optional Dependencies

Homebrew provides the symbols `:optional` and `:recommended` to allow for inclusion / exclusion of optional dependencies. If the dependency `foo` is marked as `:optional`, it is excluded by default and may be included using `--with-foo` on the command line. If `foo` is marked as `:recommended`, it is included by default and may be excluded by using `--without-foo` on the command line.

Thus, the following

    option "with-foo"
    depends_on "foo" if build.with? "foo"

is redundant and should be replaced with the simpler and more readable

    depends_on "foo" => :optional

#### Locating Dependencies

There is no good reason to refer to `HOMEBREW_PREFIX` in a formula. Please keep in mind that dependencies may be unlinked at build time. Brew will complain if a dependency is unlinked but that is a historical remnant that is probably bound to disappear. If you need to refer to the location of libraries or header files, please use `Formula["foo"].opt_lib`,  `Formula["foo"].opt_include`, `Formula["foo"].opt_prefix`, etc.

#### Testing / Checking

This should become a classic:

    option "without-check", "Disable build-time checking (not recommended)"
    ...
    system "make"
    system "make", "check" if build.with? "check"
    system "make", "install"

#### Building in a 64 Bit Environment

    ENV.m64 if MacOS.prefer_64_bit?

#### Ternary Operator

The one-liners

    arch = MacOS.prefer_64_bit? ? "macosx64" : "macosx"

and

    arch = if MacOS.prefer_64_bit? then "macosx64" else "macosx" end

should be preferred to the multi-line `if` block, and, with a little habit, are more readable.

#### OpenMP

The current version of Clang, which is the default C compiler used in Homebrew, doesn't support OpenMP, but GCC does. Here's an example of alerting the user that OpenMP will not be enabled if using Clang:

    opoo "Clang does not support OpenMP. Compile with gcc if this is not acceptable." if ENV.compiler == :clang

This snippet will not abort compilation but output a warning message.

#### MPI

Please do not duplicate options for enabling MPI in a formula. For instance

    option "with-mpi"
    depends_on :mpi => [:f90, :c, :cxx] if build.with? "mpi"

is redundant and should be replaced with

    depends_on :mpi => [:f90, :c, :cxx, :optional]

Depending on `:mpi` is more flexible than depending directly on `mpich2` or `open-mpi`. Remember that users could have installed either and that the two `conflict_with` each other.

#### Checking What Options Were Used to Build a Dependency

    nprocs = Tab.for_formula("foo").without?("mpi") ? 1 : 2

#### Optionally Depending Upon X11

    depends_on :x11 => :optional  # or :recommended
